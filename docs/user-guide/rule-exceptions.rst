STIG Rule Exceptions
########################################

DISA has republished a number of Rules with same Rule ID but different content. These rule make up a only a tiny fraction of a percent (0.014%) of the total Rules published in the DISA Reference STIGs, but do have some consequences for evaluation. 

If a STIG Rule has been republished, only the LATEST version of the Rule will maintain a Review. 
The correct STIG Rule content will be displayed when viewing an older Revision of a STIG, but the Review displayed will be the Review for the latest version of the Rule. Updates made to that particular Review when viewing old Revisions will only affect the latest STIG's Review.

The STIG Manager team is developing a method for approaching these particular cases, but for now the tool will work in the way described above.
