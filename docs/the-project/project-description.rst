Project Description and Resources
########################################


This document describes the purpose, requirements, deliverables, artifacts, tools, resources, and technologies that contribute to the STIG Manager Project. 
All project materials, including this document, are available from the `Project Repository on GitHub. <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager>`__ 

Purpose
=====================

STIG Manager is an Open Source API and Web app for managing the assessment of Information Systems for compliance with security checklists published by the United States (U.S.) Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).  STIG Manager supports the RMF process by managing STIG assessments throughout the lifecycle of a system. Data owners can expose assessment data using role-based access controls and track the progress of their assessment teams. By serving as the single source of truth about Assets, STIGs, and their current assessment status, STIG Manager enables an efficient and auditable RMF Process.  

The STIG Manager OSS Project is developed under a DoD initiative to create and maintain cloud-ready Open Source software with a fully-defined API, reference clients, documentation, and other needed resources. 

All source code and materials are tracked and available on GitHub in the Project Repository.  The Project repository is the authoritative source for all project materials.  All project materials are licensed under the `MIT License <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/blob/main/LICENSE.md>`__, with the exception of the client, which is licensed under the `GNU GPL v3 <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/blob/main/LICENSE.md>`__.

The Project maintainers and contributors comply with the policies specified in the `Project's CONTRIBUTING.md document and the Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO). <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__

Project maintainers regularly engage and consult with the user community to solicit feedback, ensure the project is meeting the needs of the user community, and develop ideas for future feature development.
