Examples and Sample Data
#############################################################


This document lists examples and sample data resources maintained by the STIG Manager Team.  These examples are intended to demonstrate the functions of the project, and should not be used for Production Deployments without modification. 



Sample Data
===================

`Sample data to populate STIG Manager with an assortment of generated Collections, Assets, STIG Assignments, and Reviews is available in our repo. <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/tree/main/data/appdata>`_

Load this data with the feature described here :ref:`app-data`

This data set will not load unless the `STIG Library Compilation <https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/compilations/>`_ has been imported. 



Containers
======================================

The STIG Manager project delivers the application in the form of two container images on Docker Hub. 
Several sample containers and Docker orchestrations are also provided to easily bring the App up in demonstration or test configurations.
