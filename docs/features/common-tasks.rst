Build A Collection with .ckl or XCCDF Files
===============================================

Create your Collection (with the `+Create Collection...` node of the Nav Tree) and go to its Collection Management workspace by clicking the "gear" icon on the node for your Collection in the Nav Tree. You can also Manage your Collection by opening the main Collection Dashboard and clicking the "Manage" button in the Inventory block.
From the Collection Management Workspace, select the "Import CKL or XCCDF..." button in the Asset Panel, then check out the :ref:`Collection Builder` portion of our User Guide for more info.


Review a STIG on an Asset
===================================

Many STIGs do not have automated evaluations, and even after automated results are imported, many Rules may still require additional manual Evaluation.  The Asset Review Workspace in STIG Manager provides a comprehensive environment for Users to complete Evaluations of a specific STIG on an an Asset, and set statuses that can be used to gauge progress.

Use the :ref:`Asset Review Workspace` to manually review individual STIG Rules, import results from .ckl or XCCDF files, compare Reviews to other Assets in the Collection, and to see a History of Reviews for that Asset. 


Review an entire Collection at once
=============================================

Many Collections will contain Assets that are assigned the same STIG.  The Collection Review Workspace allows Evaluators and Validators to step through each Rule in the STIG and view each Asset's Review and Status in one place. Restricted Users will only see the Assets they have been assigned, while Users with higher grants to the Collection will see every Asset.  Comments, Evaluations, and Statuses can all be edited via this interface, which also offers bulk actions for Submitting and Accepting Reviews.  This interface also provides an export option that will produce a .zip archive of .ckls representing the state of every Asset in the Collection that has this STIG. 

See the User Guide's section on the :ref:`Collection Review Workspace` for more information. 


Set the Default STIG Revision for a Collection
=================================================

By default, STIG Manager presents and calculates all Metrics against the latest Revision of STIG in the system.  To override this behavior, Collection Owners and Managers can "Pin" their Collection to a specific Revision of a STIG.  All Review Workspaces for the Collection will open with the pinned Revision, and all Metrics will be calculated against the pinned Revision. 

See the User Guide's section on  :ref:`Revision Pinning <pin-revision>` for more information. 


Accept and Reject STIG Reviews
====================================

To help advance through the RMF process, Collection Owners (often RMF Validators) can Accept STIG Reviews individually or in bulk using the :ref:`Collection Review Workspace`.  Collection Owners can also "Reject" Reviews and provide a Feedback comment to the Reviewer, which will require them to make further modification before submitting the Review again. 

Check out the :ref:`Collection Review Workspace` portion of the User Guide for more information. 


Analyze Findings and generate a POA&M
==============================================

The Findings Report provides a roll-up of every "Open" Evaluation in a Collection, and allows you to drill down into the contributing Asset Reviews.  A POA&M-style spreadsheet of these Findings can also be exported.

Check the User Guide for more information about the :ref:`Findings Report`.


Check evaluation progress
==============================

The :ref:`Collection Dashboard` allows Users to gauge the work involved and the progress made towards evaluating every Asset and STIG in their Collection.  

The :ref:`Collection Dashboard` also tallies the number of "Open" findings and their severity. 


Add Users
==============================

To a Collection
-------------------

If you have Manage or Owner access to a Collection, you can grant access to that Collection to other Users. 
Check ou the :ref:`User Grants <grants-panel>` section of the user guide for a description of this feature, or the :ref:`glossary <terminology>` for more information about :term:`User Access Levels. <User>`


To the System
------------------

Adding a user to STIG Manager will be dependent on the way your Organization has configured your Authentication. Check out the :ref:`Adding Users` portion of the Setup Guide for more information. 


Export Results
===============================

From the Collection Management panel, you can export Results for Assets to another Collection, or download a .zip Archive of .ckl files for your entire Collection or some portion of it.  

These exports are available organized :ref:`by Asset <export-by-asset>` or :ref:`by STIG. <export-by-stig>`

Transfer Assets to Another Collection
==========================================

Assets can be moved from one Collection to another if a User has "Manage" or "Owner" grants on both Collections. 

Transfer Assets with the :ref:`"Transfer To" button in the Manage Collection Workspace.<transfer-asset>`


Tag Assets with Labels
=========================

If you have Manage or Owner access to a Collection, you can create labels in your Collection that can be used to tag Assets. Tagging assets can allow you set up groups of Assets, or mark them them as a certain team's responsibility, or sort them more effectively.

Check out the :ref:`Labels <labels-tab>` section of the user guide for a further description of this feature. 


Create a new set of STIG Assignments based on an existing set
===================================================================================

You can assign a new STIG to a set of Assets that already have a particular STIG assigned to them. You might do this if you have a set of Assets assigned a Windows STIG, and want to assign all those Assets the Windows Defender STIG, or if the latest DISA STIG release changed the Benchmark ID of a STIG to something new (for example, from **MS_**\ WINDOWS_10_STIG to WINDOWS_10_STIG). 

From the Manage Collection interface:
   #. In the lower right panel, select the STIG you want to base the new set of assignments off of and click the "Modify..." button.
   #. From the resulting STIG Assignments pop-up, select the pull-down button from the STIG Selector.
   #. Scroll and/or filter to find the STIG you want, and select it.
   #. Select any other desired Assets for assignment. 
   #. Click "Save".

A new set of Assignments will be created for the new STIG. 


Update Reference STIGs
========================

DISA releases new STIGs every quarter (and often in-between scheduled releases).  STIG Manager will retain older STIG revisions that have been imported as long as the Benchmark ID in the STIG remains the same.  All STIG Assignments made to Assets will be preserved, and will refer to the latest version of the STIG that was imported (unless otherwise pinned to a specific Revision in the Collection [This feature is not yet fully implemented]).

Most STIG updates only change a small fraction of the Rules therein. STIG Manager tracks reviews using the Rule Version and Rule Check Content, so in most cases a completely reviewed Asset with a new STIG will still have most of the Reviews already populated and in the same state they were in before the update. 


Download the new STIGs from DISA, and upload the STIGs you want to update using the :ref:`STIGS Import interface. <stig-updates>`
