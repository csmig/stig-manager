STIG Manager OSS Setup and Technical Information
########################################################## 

The STIG Manager open-source project provides an API and Web Client. The project is ideal for deployment as containerized service components that are part of a fully orchestrated individual or enterprise STIG Manager web application, but can also be run from source code in a Node.js runtime environment, or precompiled binaries. 

Several deployment approaches are described in this document:

- :ref:`Deploy our sample Docker Compose orchestration<deploy-docker-compose>`
- :ref:`Deploy our sample Docker Compose orchestration with CAC Authentication and nginx proxy <deploy-docker-compose-CAC>`
- :ref:`Deploy with Individual Containers <deploy-container>`
- :ref:`Deploy from Source Code in Node.js runtime environment <deploy-from-source>`
- :ref:`Deploy precompiled binaries <deploy-with-binaries>`


A STIG Manager deployment requires at least two other mandatory services, which are freely available but must be provided and configured by the those deploying the STIG Manager instance:
  - An OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider
  - A MySQL database

A sample orchestration, which includes the STIGMan API, Web Client, a Keycloak container, and a MySQL container, is available on our Docker Hub page. Follow the `Quick Start Orchestration instructions on Docker Hub. <https://hub.docker.com/r/nuwcdivnpt/stig-manager>`_

Another sample orchestration, which includes the STIGMan API, Web Client, Keycloak container, MySQL container, and nginx proxy that implements CAC authentication is available from our STIGMan Orchestration repository. Please see the `guide provided in our STIGMan Orchestration repository. <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stigman-orchestration>`_

The STIG Manager application is often deployed at the enterprise level with orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes or OpenShift. However, containerization allows STIG Manager deployments to be readily scaled up or down and it can be orchestrated on a single laptop with tools such as docker-compose.

.. note::
  Containerized deployments of STIG manager are highly recommended because they offer improved security, scalability, portability, and maintenance, but they are not required. It is entirely possible to deploy the STIG Manager API and some or all supporting applications in a traditional manner from source code or installers.  In almost all cases, the same configuration options documented here or elsewhere would apply. 



Common Components 
=================

  :width: 50%
  :show_caption: True 
  :title: Component Diagram



-------------------------------

Required and optional components of a STIG Manager OSS deployment:

**API** (Always Required)
  A RESTful API implemented on the current LTS version of Node.js and the Express web application framework. Exposes 1 HTTP port. Built as a stateless container service.
**Web Client** (Recommended for Interactive Access)
  A Single Page Application (SPA) using the ExtJS 3.4 JavaScript framework. The Web Client is often enabled as static content from the API container which does not require a separate container.
**OIDC Provider**  (Always Required)
  An authentication service that manages user accounts and issues OAuth2 JWT tokens to the Web Client which authorize access to the API. We routinely test using Red Hat Keycloak and fully support Keycloak as an OIDC Provider of choice. More limited testing has been done using authentication services from Okta and Azure AD.
**MySQL Database**  (Always Required)
  A stateful data storage capability that supports mutual TLS authentication and secure data at rest.

.. _deploy-container:

Container Deployment with Docker
-------------------------------------------------

Using the STIG Manager container image is the recommended way to deploy the app. These instructions specify a Docker deployment, but the app will run just as well in a Kubernetes or other orchestration environment. Using this deployment approach satisfies the application's NodeJS requirement.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_
- :ref:`OIDC Authentication Provider <keycloak>`
- :ref:`mySQL`


Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Install Docker 
#. Install and configure the Authentication and Database requirements. Sample configuration instructions for these requirements can be found here:

   - :ref:`keycloak`
   - :ref:`mySQL`

   *Make note of the address and ports these servers are using (as well as any other values that differ from the defaults). Set the appropriate* :ref:`Environment Variables` *to these values so STIG Manager will be able to reach them*

#. Pull the latest image from Docker Hub. This command will grab the image based on the Iron Bank NodeJS hardened image:  ``docker pull nuwcdivnpt/stig-manager:latest-ironbank``
#. Run the STIG Manager image using the ``docker run`` command. Specify Environment Variables if the defaults in the :ref:`Environment Variables` reference do not work for your environment. Set the Environment Variables using ``-e <Variable Name>=<value>`` parameters. A sample docker run command, exposing port 54000, and creating a container named "stig-manager" is shown here:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker run --name stig-manager -d \
      -p 54000:54000 \
      -e STIGMAN_DB_HOST=<DATABASE_IP> \
      -e STIGMAN_DB_PORT=<DATABASE_PORT> \
      -e STIGMAN_OIDC_PROVIDER=http://<KEYCLOAK_IP>:<KEYCLOAK_PORT>/auth/realms/stigman \
      nuwcdivnpt/stig-manager


#. Check the logs by running ``docker logs`` to verify successful startup.  Sample log entries showing the end of a successful startup are shown below.  Check the :ref:`logging` reference for more detailed information.

  .. code-block :: bash

      [START] Checking classification...
      [START] Server is listening on port 64001
      [START] API is available at /api
      [START] API documentation is available at /api-docs
      [START] Client is available at /


.. _deploy-from-source:

Deployment from Source Code
-------------------------------

STIG Manager can be deployed from source if the proper Node.js runtime is provided. These instructions relate to a Windows deployment, but the app will run just as well wherever Node.js is available. 


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Node.js LTS <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_
- :ref:`OIDC Authentication Provider <keycloak>`
- :ref:`mySQL`
- `git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_ *(recommended)*


Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#. Install Node.js  
#. Install and configure the Authentication and Database requirements. Sample configuration instructions for these requirements can be found here:

   - :ref:`keycloak`
   - :ref:`mySQL`

   *Make note of the address and ports these servers are using (as well as any other values that differ from the defaults). Set the appropriate* :ref:`Environment Variables` *to these values so STIG Manager will be able to reach them*

#. Using git, Clone the repository or just download from the `release archive directly <github.com/nuwcdivnpt/stig-manager/releases>`__ and unzip into the desired folder. ``git clone https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager.git``
#. Navigate to ``/api/source`` directory in the project folder. 
#. Run ``npm ci`` to install the required Node.js packages specified in the package-lock.json file. 
#. Set Environment Variables as appropriate for your environment. Windows cmd example: ``set STIGMAN_DB_HOST=10.0.0.6``
#. From the ``/api/source`` directory, start Node, specifying the index.js file:  ``node index.js``

.. note::
  When running from source, the client files are located at ``../../client/src`` relative to the API directory. You can build a minimized client distribution by running ``client/build.sh``, which will place files at ``../../client/dist``. Set the ``STIGMAN_CLIENT_DIRECTORY`` environment variable as appropriate.

.. note::
  It is recommended that you make use of a process manager such as `PM2 <https://github.com/Unitech/pm2>`_ when deploying from source, to monitor the app and keep it running.

.. _deploy-with-binaries:

Deployment Precompiled Binaries
----------------------------------

STIG Manager can be deployed with the binaries made available `with each release. <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/releases>`_


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Precompiled Binaries <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/releases>`_
- :ref:`OIDC Authentication Provider <keycloak>`
- :ref:`mySQL`


Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


#. Download the `precompiled binaries <https://github.com/NUWCDIVNPT/stig-manager/releases>`_
#. Install and configure the Authentication and Database requirements. Sample configuration instructions for these requirements can be found here:

   - :ref:`keycloak`
   - :ref:`mySQL`

   *Make note of the address and ports these servers are using (as well as any other values that differ from the defaults). Set the appropriate* :ref:`Environment Variables` *to these values so STIG Manager will be able to reach them*

#. Set Environment Variables as appropriate for your environment. Windows cmd example: ``set STIGMAN_DB_HOST=10.0.0.6``
#. Run the downloaded binaries. 


.. note::
  It is recommended that you make use of a process manager such as `PM2 <https://github.com/Unitech/pm2>`_ when deploying from source or binaries, to monitor the app and keep it running.



Common Configuration Variables
-------------------------------------------------
The API and Web Client are configured using :ref:`Environment Variables`. They neither require nor use a configuration file.

It is likely you will have to set at least some of these Environment Variables, but check the full :ref:`Environment Variables` reference for the full list:

  * Database-related:

    - STIGMAN_DB_HOST
    - STIGMAN_DB_PORT
    - STIGMAN_DB_USER 
    - STIGMAN_DB_PASSWORD (unless using TLS for authentication)
    - STIGMAN_DB_TLS_CA_FILE 
    - STIGMAN_DB_TLS_CERT_FILE (unless using password for authentication)
    - STIGMAN_DB_TLS_KEY_FILE (unless using password for authentication)

  * Authentication-related:

    - STIGMAN_OIDC_PROVIDER
    - STIGMAN_CLIENT_OIDC_PROVIDER

  * General Configuration:
    
    - STIGMAN_API_ADDRESS
    - STIGMAN_API_PORT
    - STIGMAN_CLASSIFICATION
  
  * Swagger OpenAPI Tool Configuration:

    - STIGMAN_SWAGGER_ENABLED
    - STIGMAN_SWAGGER_AUTHORITY
    - STIGMAN_SWAGGER_REDIRECT

STIG Manager can be configured to download and import the latest STIG library on first startup. These options require access to `https://public.cyber.mil <https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/>`_ to complete. STIGs can also be imported manually. Enable this function by setting this Variable to "true":

  * STIGMAN_INIT_IMPORT_STIGS


Additional Suggested Configuration
=======================================

TLS
----
:ref:`Set up TLS with a reverse proxy to secure connections to STIG Manager. <reverse-proxy>`


Enable Extra CA Certificates
----------------------------------------
Set the ``NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=file-path`` Node.js environment variable to direct Node to accept CA certificates you have provided, in addition to its built-in CA certs. In the case of the Iron Bank based image, DoD CA certificates are already located here: ``/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/Certificates_PKCS7_v5.7_DoD.pem``

Check the `Node.js documentation for more information. <https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_extra_ca_certs_file>`_


Configure Logging
-----------------------
:ref:`Store logs according to Organization requirements. <logging>`

First Steps
==============

.. index::
   single: Add Users

.. _Adding Users:
.. _Add Users:
.. _user-roles-privs:

Configure Users
--------------------------

Users are not created in the STIG Manager application itself. All users must be authenticated by your Authentication Provider (Often, Keycloak) and be assigned the appropriate tokens, scopes, and roles before they can access the system. Upon first access after successful Authentication, STIGMan will create a user profile to which it assigns Collection Grants and assignments. 

User privileges are controlled by the Authentication Provider. This can be done by configuring and assigning Users the appropriate roles. In Keycloak, this can be done using the "Role Mappings" tab for that user, or you can set these roles as defaults using the Configure->Roles->Default Roles interface.  See the :ref:`Authentication and Identity<authentication>` section for more information. 

Assign at least one User the ``admin`` role when setting up STIG Manager for the first time. 

.. list-table:: STIG Manager User Types, STIG Manager Privileges, and suggested Roles: 
  :widths: 20 60 20
  :header-rows: 1
  :class: tight-table

  * - User Type
    - Privileges
    - Roles
  * - Administrator User
    - Access STIG Manager, Manage Collections, Import STIGs, Manage Users, Import/Export App data
    - admin, user
  * - Collection Creator User
    - Access STIG Manager, Create Collections
    - user, create_collection
  * - Restricted User  
    - Access STIG Manager
    - user

.. note::
   All Users must be explicitly granted access to Collections in order to see the Assets, STIGs, and Evaluations contained therein. Administrators can grant themselves or others access to any Collection. 

It is recommended that most users should be "Collection Creator Users"(ie. assigned the "user" and "create_collection" roles). A Restricted User will only have access to grants they have been assigned by other users. Collection Creator Users can create and manage their own collections, as well as be assigned grants from other users.

STIG Manager will automatically create its own user associations for Collection grants once an authenticated user accesses the system. The roles Admin and Collection Creator are visible in the User Grants administrative tab, but must be managed in the Authentication Provider. Specific Grants to Collections and Assets/STIGs are managed in the STIG Manager app.


Import STIGs
------------------

Up until this point, the setup has concerned the actual operational deployment of the app.  For this function, and additional functions of the App, STIG Manager Users are required.  See the :term:`User` for more information on their different roles and privileges. 

#. Download the latest `quarterly STIG Library Compilations from DISA <https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/compilations/>`_ and import it into STIG Manager. 

#. Log in to STIG Manager using an Administrator user to import STIGs. For information on how to do this, and other STIG Manager Admin functions, see the :ref:`stig-import` portion of the :ref:`admin-quickstart`.
